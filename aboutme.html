            My personal career goal is to become a professional musician.
            <br>
            I would go about doing this by going to a music school to have <br> a higher understanding of music.
            <br>
            This is my career choice because I am passionate about music.<br>
            <br>
            I have been doing music for three years,
            I've played at Stagecoach,<br>The Big Rock Pub,
            and Pappy and Harriets
            <br>
            <br>
            bottom line, I am really passionate about music and<br>
            would really enjoy doing it as a career.<br>
